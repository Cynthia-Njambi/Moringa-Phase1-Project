## Moringa Phase 1 Project
**1. Overview**

The head of Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio, but they don't know anything about creating movies.
 - This project explores the top 5 genres consumers of movies love best, it also explores what genres have the highest return on investment as well as the recommended movie runtimes.
- With the three insights I believe that the head of Microsoft will have a clear direction to move with the new movie studio.

**2. Business Understanding**

In this section will be talking about the stakeholder in this project whom I would say is the head of Microsoft a well as Microsoft as a company because he has an interest in having actionable insights for the company.

While trying to understand how to generate the actionable insights, I set three key business questions which include: 
- What are the top 5 genres that consumers love?
- What are the genres that generate the highest gross?
- What is the recommended average movie runtimes?

I set the above questions because:
- I saw that since Microsoft is new in the industry it needs to understand the consumer favourites in order to invest in film genres that consumers would engage with.
- It was also crucial for Microsoft to invest in films that would give them a high ROI(Return on Investment)
- It was also necessary to understand on average how long films should be.
