## Moringa Phase 1 Project
1. Overview
- The head of Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio, but they don't know anything about creating movies. This project explores the top 5 genres consumers of movies love best, it also explores what genres have the highest return on investment as well as the recommended movie runtimes.
- With the three insights I believe that the head of Microsoft will have a clear direction to move with the new movie studio.

2. Business Understanding
- In this section will be talking about the stakeholder in this project whom I would say is the head of Microsoft because he has an interest in having actionable insights for the company.
- While trying to understand how to generate the actionable insights, I set three key business questions which include: 
> What are the top 5 genres that consumers love?
> What are the genres that generate the highest gross?
> What is the recommended average movie runtimes?
